# CNN-to-Classify-Brain-Tumors-in-MRIs
A convolutional neural network is modelled to classify brain tumors from an MRI dataset of approximately 7,000 images.

Kaggle dataset located at:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset
This dataset contains 7023 images of human brain MRI images which are classified into
4 classes: glioma - meningioma - no tumor and pituitary.

CNN is implemented after dividing the training set into train and validation with train/val accuracies and losses. 
Images are predicted as per the model and a classification report is made.
